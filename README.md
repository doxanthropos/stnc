# Simple Telephone Number Converter
Browser extension to convert telephone numbers in websites into links to use with telephone apps.

There is a lot of documentation on the correct way to make telephone numbers clickable to autocall with your preferred phone app.
There is [CSS Tricks][css-tricks], the [Mozilla Developer Network][mdn] and [Web Fundamentals by Google][google-dev].
But still there are a lot of websites out there that do not use these kind of links for their phone numbers.

There are also some plugins for Firefox and Chrome to convert normal phone numbers, that can be found on websites into clickable phone numbers. They all need access to read and modify all webpages that are visited with these browsers. So I intend to make my own one, to make sure it does not do anything fishy or changes to do something fishy through an update, without me knowing.
